# Climate-Change-Analysis
Analysis of climate data from the Mauna Lao Observatory and Sable Island in R.

## Introduction
Using the data observed by the Mauna Lao and Sable Island observatories this report observes whether major world events have impacted the carbon dioxide concentrations in the world's atmosphere. A gamma linear model was used to observe the trend of carbon dioxide concentrations dating back to the preindustrial era, as well as to model future predictions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion data supports evidence to show that there is an increase in global temperatures coinciding with IPCC reports of 1.0 degree of global warming above preindustrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8 degrees to 1.2 degrees. Future predictions of 1.5 degree increase in temperature coincide with the predictions made using the Sable Island data.
