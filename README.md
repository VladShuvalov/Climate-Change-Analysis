# Climate-Change-Analysis
Analysis of climate data from the Mauna Lao Observatory and Sable Island in R.

##Conclusion

In conclusion data supports evidence to show that there is an increase in global temperatures coinciding with IPCC reports of 1.0 degree of global warming above preindustrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8 degrees to 1.2 degrees. Future predictions of 1.5 degree increase in temperature coincide with the predictions made using the Sable Island data.
